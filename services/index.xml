      <description>APorous specializes in custom plastic compounding and master-batching, where customers have special needs in formulation and/or processing that cannot be obtained from traditional resin manufacturers. In such cases, APorous is ideally set-up for development and manufacturing of melt blends, alloys, compatible plastic compounds, filled polymers and other polymer modifications. Examples of such applications may be breathable film resin or electrolyte conductive membranes. The product may be jointly developed between the client and APorous, or using customerâ€™s proprietary recipes.</description>
