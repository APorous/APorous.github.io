The battery industry has gone through rapid changes in the past twenty years.  We support product developments in the areas of:

- -- Separators (Lithium, Lead-Acid, Alkaline, Ceramic Coating)
<br />

- -- Food Packaging
<br />

- -- Membranes and Filters
<br />

## Available R&D Equipment:

- -- Resin dry mixers (1 to 500 kg capacity)

<br />

- -- Twin screw extruder for compounding (high shear liquid injection and vacuum capability)

<br />

- -- Thin Film Co-Extrusion (two twin screw 30mm extruders, 10 – 500 microns thickness)

<br />

- -- Cast film die width to 25 cm (multi-layers AA, AB, ABA or ABC configuration layers)

<br />

- -- Cast film lamination capability (to nonwovens)

<br />

- -- Resin moisture dryer prior to compounding (10 to 700 kg capacity)

<br />

- -- Longitudinal MDO stretch (1 to 20 m/min)

<br />

- -- Transverse TDO stretch (1 to 10 m/min, 10 cm min’ inlet, 100 cm max’ output)

<br />

- -- Laboratory biaxial stretches (4 x 4 cm)

<br />

- -- Lab testing capability (moisture, tensile, puncture, Gurley, porosity, resistance, chemical
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;stability, plus external resources)
